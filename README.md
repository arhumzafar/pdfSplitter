# pdfSplitter 
## Arhum Zafar - February 2020
<br>
Was tired of using PDF splitters to take apart documents/assignemnts/uplaods etc, since I don't have Acrobat Pro. <br>
Created a script that can split PDFs by pages straight from your command line, given the file is in your Finder/File Directory.
<br>
<br>
Make sure to import PyPDF2 prior to running; you can install it by copying what's down below. <br>
<br>
<br>
pip3 install PyPDF2 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
thanks!
